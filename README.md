## Key findings

This model suggests that CGPA is the most significant predictor towards graduate school admission. The prediction interval we would expect from our final model is 94.5%. Thus, we would expect and accuracy of approximately 95%.

## Motivation 


## Data Source

- [Graduate Admissions)](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)

## Dataset Description

This data  is related to graduate school adimission probability. The dataset contains several factors which are generally considered as important during an individual‚Äôs application to master‚Äôs programs. This factors include Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Scores; TOEFL Scores; Statement Of Purposes (SOP); Letter Of Recommendations (LOR); College GPA (CGPA); and University Ratings. 

## Methods

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Historgrams of each quantitative predictor variable 
    * Scatterplot matrix
    * An assessment of pairwise correlations between pairs of quantitative predictor variable
2. First Order Model with All Predictors
    * Residual Analysis
    * Box-Cox analysis to see if the response variable should be transformed
3. Second Model with the transormed variable vs All Predictors
    * Residual Analyis
4. Third Model using Stepwise Regression
   * AIC stepwise regression
   * Interaction Analysis
5. Fourth Model using Stepwise Regression with Centered Interaction Effects
   * Residual and Influence Anaysis
   * Variance inflation factors analysis
   * Interaction Plots

## Quick Glance at the Results

The final model is: 

Predicted chance of admission^2.5  = 0.453 + 0.171 (CGPA) + 0.029 (LOR) + 0.003 (GRE SCORE) + 0.004 (TOEFL SCORE) + 0.015(University Rating) + 0.005 (CGPA)(TOEFL SCORE) - 0.002 (LOR)(TOEFL SCORE) + 0.004 (LOR)(UNIVERSITY RATING). 0.001(GRE SCORE)((UNIVERSITY RATING))

Example Predictions from Final Model

![heatmap](pictures/example_predictions.png)

All of the six example students whose predictions are shown above have prediction intervals that contain the observed chance of admission. Furthermore, the prediction interval we would expect from this model is 94.5%.
