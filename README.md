## Motivation 


## Data Source

- [Graduate Admissions)](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)

## Dataset Description

This data  is related to graduate school adimission probability. The dataset contains several factors which are generally considered as important during an individualâ€™s application to masterâ€™s programs. This factors include Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Scores; TOEFL Scores; Statement Of Purposes (SOP); Letter Of Recommendations (LOR); College GPA (CGPA); and University Ratings. 

## Methods

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Historgrams of each quantitative predictor variable and an assessment of pairwise correlations between pairs of quantitative predictor variable.  
2. First Order Model with All Predictors
    * 
3. Second Model with the transormed variable vs All Predictors
    * 
4. Third Model using Stepwise Regression
   * 
5. Fourth Model using Stepwise Regression with Centered Interaction Effects
