## Key findings

This model suggests that College GPA and Letters of Recommendation are the most significant predictors towards graduate school admission. The prediction interval we would expect from our final model is 94.5%. Thus, we would expect and accuracy of approximately 95%.

## Motivation 

When an undergraduate student finishes their studies, they often seek to look for job opportunities or/and further their education. For those who choose to continue their academic journey by going to graduate school, understanding graduate school requirements becomes important. These requirements vary depending on each school's requirements, however, on many occasions, there are few common factors such as College GPA that can play a role in contributing to one‚Äôs chance of being accepted. Upon finishing my junior year of college, I wanted to know which graduate school requirements have more significance and would increase my chances of being accepted if I opted to futher my education.

## Dataset Description

This data  is related to graduate school adimission probability. The dataset contains several factors which are generally considered as important during an individual‚Äôs application to master‚Äôs programs. This factors include Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Scores; TOEFL Scores; Statement Of Purposes (SOP); Letter Of Recommendations (LOR); College GPA (CGPA); and University Ratings. 

## Methods

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Historgrams of each quantitative predictor variable 
    * Scatterplot matrix
    * An assessment of pairwise correlations between pairs of quantitative predictor variable
2. First Order Model with All Predictors
    * Residual Analysis
    * Box-Cox analysis to see if the response variable should be transformed
3. Second Model with the transormed variable vs All Predictors
    * Residual Analyis
4. Third Model using Stepwise Regression
   * AIC stepwise regression
   * Interaction Analysis
5. Fourth Model using Stepwise Regression with Centered Interaction Effects
   * Residual and Influence Anaysis
   * Variance inflation factors analysis
   * Interaction Plots

## Quick Glance at the Results

The final model is: 

Predicted chance of admission^2.5  = 0.453 + 0.171 (CGPA) + 0.029 (LOR) + 0.003 (GRE SCORE) + 0.004 (TOEFL SCORE) + 0.015(University Rating) + 0.005 (CGPA)(TOEFL SCORE) - 0.002 (LOR)(TOEFL SCORE) + 0.004 (LOR)(UNIVERSITY RATING). 0.001(GRE SCORE)((UNIVERSITY RATING))

Example Predictions from Final Model

All of the six example students whose predictions are shown above have prediction intervals that contain the observed chance of admission. Furthermore, the prediction interval we would expect from this model is 94.5%.

## Lessons Learned and Recommendations
- College GPA is the most significant predictor of graduate school acceptance probability
- Letters of Reccommendation is the second most significant predictor
- Given that some institutions have a minimum College GPA requirement for their Master's programs coupled with GPA's significance towards acceptance probability, it is important that one makes efforts towards maintaining a good undergraduate GPA if they wish to persue a Master's program
- Build good relationships with professors, supervisors, advisors, etc, so you can have a good letter of reccommendation and increase the likelihood that you are accepted into a Graduate Program

## Limitations and What Can Be Improved
- Each institution places importance on different factors
- Work experience is a factor not considered in this project, including this factor could enrich the analysis
